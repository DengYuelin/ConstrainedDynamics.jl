rename constraints to joints in Constraint
better setinit! function
set velocity function
zero alloc store
3rd order integrator
check for sqrt error / limit linesearch
regularize properly / Augmented Lagrangian
Fix constraint types / make unambigous / typestable
add prismatic joint
add general 1-3d rot and trans joints
add closed chain init solver
loop flag?
seperate rot from trans -> 3x3 instead of 6x6
add joint coordinates and torques
better quaternion math/julia code
change behavior when linesearch fails
make visualize faster
make shapes and visualization a proper part of everything
Use ̇q=q_{k+1}⊗q_k†/dt instead of q_{k+1}-q_k†/dt
